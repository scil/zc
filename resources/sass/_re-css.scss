Bootstrap 3 - Disabled dropdown links
Bootstrap 3 has built-in visual support for disabled dropdown menu items, however these are simply
visual changes and don't actually impact the interactivity of the element itself.
Once this is added to your styles, you can easily disable any dropdown item by applying a [disabled] attribute
to the <a/> element itself, and adding the usual .disabled class to the parent <li>.

Mimic cursor style from native .dropdown-menu > .disabled > a{} styles,
since `pointer-events: none` kills the cursor state, too.
*/
.dropdown-menu > .disabled {
  //cursor: not-allowed;
  cursor: $cursor-disabled;
}

/* The real magic ;) */
//.dropdown-menu > .disabled > a {
//  pointer-events: none;
//}

//  replace above
a[disabled] {
    pointer-events: none;
}
